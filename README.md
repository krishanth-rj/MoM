## Development

This repo uses **Bun** as the package manager and lockfile source of truth.

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
bun run build
bun run lint
```

Do not commit `package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, or `yarn.lock`.


## AI Pipeline Architecture

The application uses a two-stage AI pipeline for meeting minutes generation:

```
Audio Recording / Upload
            │
            ▼
      Faster-Whisper
(Local Speech-to-Text)
            │
            ▼
      Clean Transcript
            │
            ▼
     POST /api/summarize
            │
            ▼
          Groq LLM
            │
            ▼
 Structured JSON Output
            │
            ▼
Frontend Rendering
(MoM, Executive Summary, Highlights, Decisions, Action Items, SOP)
```

### Components

1. **Faster-Whisper Service** (Speech-to-Text)
   - Responsible ONLY for speech-to-text transcription
   - Language detection
   - Returns transcript text
   - Configured via `WHISPER_SERVICE_URL` environment variable

2. **Groq LLM** (AI Summarization)
   - Receives ONLY transcript text (never raw audio)
   - Generates structured meeting analysis:
     - Executive Summary
     - Meeting Summary
     - Key Highlights
     - Decisions
     - Action Items
     - Risks
     - SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
   - Configured via `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/transcribe` - Forwards audio to Faster-Whisper service
- `POST /api/summarize` - Sends transcript to Groq for structured analysis


## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file based on `.env.example`:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Faster-Whisper Transcription Service
# URL of the existing Faster-Whisper HTTP service
WHISPER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Groq API Configuration
# Used for AI summarization and MoM generation
GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key

# Optional: Supabase Audio Storage Bucket
SUPABASE_AUDIO_BUCKET=meeting-audio
```

### Required Services

1. **Faster-Whisper Service** (Local Speech-to-Text)
   - **Dependency:** This service MUST be running before starting the application
   - Must be running and accessible at `WHISPER_SERVICE_URL` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`)
   - Responsible ONLY for speech-to-text transcription and language detection
   - Expected to accept POST requests with JSON body:
     ```json
     {
       "audio_url": "string",
       "meeting_id": "string",
       "audio_file_id": "string"
     }
     ```
   - Expected to return JSON:
     ```json
     {
       "text": "transcript text",
       "language": "detected language",
       "duration": 120
     }
     ```
   - **Important:** This service should already be implemented and working. Do NOT modify it.

2. **Groq API Key** (AI Summarization)
   - Sign up at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)
   - Create an API key
   - Add to `.env.local` as `GROQ_API_KEY`
   - **Note:** Groq receives ONLY transcript text, never raw audio


## Startup Order

1. **Start Faster-Whisper service** first
   ```bash
   # Example: Start your existing Faster-Whisper service on port 8000
   # Ensure WHISPER_SERVICE_URL in .env.local matches the service URL
   ```

2. **Start the Next.js application**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Verify services are running**
   - Faster-Whisper: `curl http://localhost:8000/health` (or your configured endpoint)
   - Next.js: Open `http://localhost:3000`

## AI Request Flow

1. **User records/upload audio** → Frontend
2. **Audio saved to Supabase Storage** → API Route
3. **Transcription request** → `/api/transcribe` → Faster-Whisper service
   - Returns: transcript text, language, duration
   - Error 503 if service unavailable
4. **Summarization request** → `/api/summarize` → Groq LLM
   - Input: transcript text only
   - Returns: structured JSON with executive summary, highlights, decisions, action items, risks, SOP
   - Error 502 if service fails

## Security Notes

- `GROQ_API_KEY` is server-side only and never exposed to the client
- `WHISPER_SERVICE_URL` is server-side only
- No API keys or secrets are imported into client components
- Raw transcripts, prompts, and generated content are not logged
- Audio files are never sent to Groq
