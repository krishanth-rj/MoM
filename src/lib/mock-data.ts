export const MOCK_TRANSCRIPT = `[00:00] Aryan: Alright everyone, let's get started. Today we're doing the Q2 sprint planning. I'll be taking notes. We have Priya, Rahul, and Sneha joining.

[00:18] Priya: Thanks Aryan. So the main thing I wanted to discuss is the auth module. From a design perspective, we've got the wireframes ready but we need a final call on the flow for password reset.

[00:35] Rahul: From the backend side, the auth module is going to touch a lot of the existing tables. I'd suggest we start with just email-password login and add OAuth in the next sprint.

[00:52] Sneha: That makes sense. The staging environment isn't fully set up yet either, so if we rush OAuth integration it could create blockers for QA.

[01:08] Aryan: Agreed. So decision one — auth module first, OAuth in sprint 3. Rahul, can you have the API spec ready by June 2nd?

[01:20] Rahul: Yes, that's doable. I'll also document the endpoints in Swagger.

[01:28] Priya: I can have the updated UI designs for the login and reset flow by June 3rd. I'll share them in Figma.

[01:40] Aryan: Perfect. Sneha, staging environment by when?

[01:45] Sneha: I can have the base environment up by June 4th. Might need some help from Rahul on the DB config.

[01:52] Rahul: Sure, just ping me on Slack.

[02:00] Aryan: Great. One more thing — weekly syncs. I'm thinking every Monday at 10am. Does that work for everyone?

[02:08] Priya, Rahul, Sneha: Works for us.

[02:12] Aryan: Alright, let's wrap up. We'll do a follow-up on June 5th to check on progress.`;

**Agenda:**
${form.agenda || "1. Project updates\n2. Planning\n3. Action items"}

---

**Discussion Points:**

1. **Auth Module Priority** — The team agreed to prioritize email-password authentication in the current sprint. OAuth will be deferred to Sprint 3 to reduce scope and avoid staging environment blockers.

2. **Staging Environment** — The staging environment is not fully ready. Setup is targeted for June 4th, with potential support needed on the database configuration side.

3. **Design Handoff** — UI wireframes for login and password reset flows are ready. Final designs will be shared via Figma by June 3rd.

4. **Weekly Sync Cadence** — The team aligned on a recurring Monday sync at 10:00 AM to maintain project momentum.

---

**Decisions Made:**

- Auth module (email-password only) moves to top priority
- OAuth integration pushed to Sprint 3
- Weekly Monday standups at 10:00 AM

---

**Action Items:**

| Owner | Task | Deadline |
|-------|------|----------|
| Rahul | Finalize API spec + Swagger docs | June 2 |
| Priya | Updated login/reset UI designs in Figma | June 3 |
| Sneha | Staging environment setup | June 4 |

---

**Next Steps:**
Follow-up meeting scheduled for June 5th to review progress on all action items.`;
